### Note (outside code source):

1. This challenge is very similar to a tutorial in a class I did on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtman. So, the code might be similar, and I borrowed lots of his CSS styles. However, Jonas allows us to use the code freely.

2. Some of the questions I used are copied from W3School.
